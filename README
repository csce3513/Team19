download the .exe framework from the following URL
http://sourceforge.net/projects/asunit/files/latest/download?source=files

once you have downloaded it, run the .exe to install the files.
make sure the installer creates a desktop shortcut.
install the files into the default directory, it should be "c/programfiles(x86)/asunit
  if you dont have 64bit windows, it will be c/programfiles/asunit

once you have it installed, go to the shortcut on your desktop. we have to modify the
icon because for some reason it doesnt launch correctly. i think its because the 
safety settings for windows are weird.

right click the icon on your desktop, and go to 'properties'
inside the properties window, go to the 'shortcut' tab.

inside the 'target' field, enter the following:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\AsUnit\xulrunner\xulrunner.exe" --app ../xului/application.ini

there is only 1 space between the chunks of text. make sure to close the "" after .exe

after you've edited that, go to the 'start in' field, and enter the following:
"C:\Program Files (x86)\AsUnit\xului"

click apply, and close the properties window. double click the icon, and you should be ready to roll!
